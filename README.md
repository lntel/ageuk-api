# Description
This is the Age UK RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). This API controls all of the actions of the primary application and all of its entities. 

The API connects to Postgres directly using NestJS's in-built [Typeorm integration](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-typeorm).
